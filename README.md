## Welcome visitor! 

My name is Lorenzo Navarini and I am a Master student at the University of Vienna. Previously, I have been a Research Assistant at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. In August, I am going to be Research Assistant for the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research (https://www.euro.centre.org/). 

My research interests are: macroeconomics, political economy, labour economics and health economics.

I plan to apply for a PhD.

On this website, you can find more about myself and my research projects.
